# See-Password-Chrome-Extension

A simple Google Chrome extension that allows the user to hover their cursor over a password to reveal the password
It has a simple toggle switch if you want to disable the extension.

This is also my first time creating a Chrome extension so it's rather simple, but functional :)

To install simply enter chrome://extensions/ into your Google Chrome browser and click on load unpacked in top left corner and select this repository and the extension should start working
